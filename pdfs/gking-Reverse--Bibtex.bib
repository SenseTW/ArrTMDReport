	abstract = {Existing research on the extensive Chinese censorship organization uses observational\&nbsp;methods with well-known limitations. We conducted the first large-scale experimental\&nbsp;study of censorship by creating accounts on numerous social media sites, randomly\&nbsp;submitting different texts, and observing from a worldwide network of computers which\&nbsp;texts were censored and which were not. We also supplemented interviews with\&nbsp;confidential sources by creating our own social media site, contracting with Chinese firms\&nbsp;to install the same censoring technologies as existing sites, and{\textemdash}with their software,\&nbsp;documentation, and even customer support{\textemdash}reverse-engineering how it all works. Our\&nbsp;results offer rigorous support for the recent hypothesis that criticisms of the state, its\&nbsp;leaders, and their policies are published, whereas posts about real-world events with\&nbsp;collective action potential are censored.},
